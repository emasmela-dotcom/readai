---

### **Phase 2: Website Integration** (15 minutes)

#### Update Your index.html with Gumroad Links

Find the payment buttons in your index.html and update them:

```html
<!-- Premium 6-Month Plan -->
<a href="https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/readai-premium" 
   class="gumroad-button" 
   target="_blank" 
   data-gumroad-single-product="true">
    Buy Premium - $3
</a>

<!-- Pro 1-Year Plan -->
<a href="https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/readai-pro" 
   class="gumroad-button" 
   target="_blank" 
   data-gumroad-single-product="true">
    Buy Pro - $5
</a>
```

#### Add Gumroad Overlay Script

Add this before closing `</body>` tag in index.html:

```html
<!-- Gumroad Overlay Script -->
<script src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad.js"></script>
```

This enables Gumroad's checkout overlay for a better user experience.

---

### **Phase 3: Test Purchase Flow** (10 minutes)

#### Test with Gumroad Test Mode:

1. In Gumroad dashboard, go to **"Settings"** → **"Advanced"**
2. Enable **"Test Mode"**
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Test the full purchase flow:
   - Click "Buy Premium" on your site
   - Gumroad checkout opens
   - Enter test card details
   - Complete purchase
   - Verify you receive confirmation email
   - Check delivery instructions are correct

#### Test Access Code System:

**Current Implementation Check:**
1. Look for access code validation in your index.html
2. Search for: `"Enter Code"` or `checkMemberStatus()`

**If Access Code System Exists:**
- Test entering the access code you receive
- Verify premium features unlock
- Check that subscription status is stored

**If No Access Code System:**
- You may need to add this functionality
- Or use simple honor system (trust users who pay)
- Or integrate Gumroad License Keys API

---

### **Phase 4: Live Testing** (5 minutes)

#### After Deployment:

1. **Disable Test Mode** in Gumroad
2. Make a **real $3 purchase** to test:
   - Click your own "Buy Premium" button
   - Complete real purchase with your card
   - Verify email delivery
   - Test access code (if implemented)
   - Request refund from yourself (to test refund flow)

---

## 🔧 Access Code Implementation Options

### **Option A: Simple Honor System** (Easiest)
- Users pay, get confirmation
- No code validation needed
- Trust-based access
- **Pros:** Simple, no coding
- **Cons:** Can be abused

### **Option B: Manual Access Codes** (Recommended for MVP)
- Generate random codes in Gumroad
- Users enter code on site
- Store in localStorage
- **Pros:** Simple, works well
- **Cons:** Manual code generation

### **Option C: Gumroad License Keys API** (Advanced)
- Automatically validate purchases
- Real-time verification
- Secure and scalable
- **Pros:** Fully automated, secure
- **Cons:** Requires API integration

---

## 📝 Quick Implementation: Access Code System

If you want to add basic access code validation, add this to your index.html:

```html
<script>
// Simple access code system
const validCodes = {
    'PREMIUM2024': { plan: 'premium', expires: '2024-12-31' },
    'PRO2024': { plan: 'pro', expires: '2025-12-31' }
};

function checkAccessCode() {
    const code = prompt('Enter your access code:');
    if (code && validCodes[code]) {
        localStorage.setItem('readai_subscription', JSON.stringify(validCodes[code]));
        alert('✅ Access activated! Enjoy premium features.');
        location.reload();
    } else {
        alert('❌ Invalid access code. Please try again.');
    }
}

function checkMemberStatus() {
    const subscription = localStorage.getItem('readai_subscription');
    if (subscription) {
        const sub = JSON.parse(subscription);
        const now = new Date();
        const expires = new Date(sub.expires);
        return now < expires;
    }
    return false;
}

// Add to your subscription button click handler
// <button onclick="checkAccessCode()">Enter Access Code</button>
</script>
```
