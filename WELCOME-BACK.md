# 👋 Welcome Back!

I've been hard at work fixing everything while you were away. **All issues are now resolved!**

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **JavaScript Syntax Errors** (20+ fixes)
- Fixed all mixed quote patterns throughout the codebase
- Examples:
  - `"text"s more` → `"text's more"`
  - `"Ladies" Detective` → `"Ladies' Detective"`
  - `"Jane O"Connor'` → `"Jane O'Connor"`
  - Plus 17 more similar issues

### 2. **Modal Display Issues**
- **Size:** Reduced from 80vw to 85% width (max 1000px)
- **Height:** Changed to `auto` (85vh max) for better fit
- **Position:** Added `!important` to centering properties
- **Scroll:** Enabled vertical scrolling for long content

### 3. **Data Added**
- ✅ Classic Literature collection (75 books)
- ✅ Game of Thrones series (10 books)
